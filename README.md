**Master's degree in OMICS Data Science at UVic**

This is my final thesis repository. During my TFM I worked for Sequentia Biotech, Barcelona. During this period we explored some machine learning techniques in oerder to imporve GAIA's capacity (GAIA, is a metagenomics online software) of classify strains. The codes related to the pre-processing part are located in the Wiki, while the codes related to the machine learning are described in "Final_code_TFM.ipynb".

**Enjoy!**
